* Select your files by using your explorer \(click on "Select files"\) or with drag&drop into the drop zone.  ![](../../.gitbook/assets/important.png) Important: there is no file limit from wgGallery, how many files you want to upload at once, but you are limited maybe by the system settings \(php settings\). You can check your settings under maintenance [System check](../administration-menu/maintenance/system-check.md)
* After adding the files wgGallery checks the images whether they are fullfilling the conditions:

  * Is the allowed maximum size exceeded?
  * Is the allowed image dimension \(width or height\) exceeded?

  ![](../../.gitbook/assets/important.png) You can change settings for allowed size/image dimension in [Options for image upload](../preferences/options-for-image-upload.md)

* If all files fullfill the conditions this will be confirmed  ![](../../.gitbook/assets/upload2.png) 
* wgGallery takes the file name as default for image title. if you want to change you can click on the suggested title or on the pen and change as you want  ![](../../.gitbook/assets/upload3.png) 
* Start upload
* Processes during upload
  * Storing original image \(if selected in preferences [Options for image upload](../preferences/options-for-image-upload.md)\)
  * Resizing image corresponding settings in preferences [Options for image upload](../preferences/options-for-image-upload.md)
  * Adding watermark, if a watermark is linked with current album \(see [Albums](../administration-menu/albums.md) and [Watermarks](../administration-menu/watermarks.md)\)
