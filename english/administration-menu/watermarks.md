# Watermarks

You can define various watermarks, which you can added to oploaded images.  
You can also decide to which kind of image it will be added. The watermark will be added during upload process.  
Once a watermark is added it can not be removed again.

If you store the original images also then you can later recreate large/medium/thumb images with new or without a watermark.

You can link each album with another watermark.
